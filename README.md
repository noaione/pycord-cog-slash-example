This is a quick example of `slash_command`, `user_command`, and `message_command` usage for [pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord).

## Testing/Installation
0. I recommend creating a virtualenv and entering it first.
1. Install requirements by: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Make sure you have git installed.
2. Create `token.txt` with you bot token
3. Run the bot with: `python bot.py`
